## Process

We passed by the several steps:

### Step 1 - First signal recorded

Int he first step we've recorded data 

This was the first signal extracted from bitalino

We concluded that we needed to use a better electrodes position

### Step 2 - Improved signal

...


### Step 3 - Defining the signal processing stages

### Step 4 - Real time tests

### Step 5 - The final outcome

## Code example


``` python
from numpy import *
from pylab import *
s = randn(100)
plot(s)
show()

```
